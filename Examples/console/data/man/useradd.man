DESCRIPTION
    The useradd command creates a new user account using the values specified on the command line
    plus the default values from the system.

OPTIONS
    The options which apply to the useradd command are:

    -g

        If not specified, the user will be assigned to the group 100(users) by default.

        greater than or equal to UID_MIN (1000) and greater than every other user.
