muwerk is a cooperative scheduler with mqtt-like queues.

Dependencies
------------

muwerk relies only on [ustd](https://github.com/muwerk/ustd). Check documentation for
required [platform defines](https://github.com/muwerk/ustd/blob/master/README.md).

Project overview
----------------

muwerk provides a cooperative scheduler that allows fixed-intervall task creation on
platforms from attiny up to ESP32 and Linux. (Linux support for testing with debuggers
and valgrind.)

Tasks can simply be created by:
```c++
#define __ESP__ 1  // replace with appropriate platform define
#include "scheduler.h"

ustd::Scheduler sched;

void myTask() {
    // add code for this task here
}

void setup() {
    int tID = sched.add(myTask, "taskname", 50000L);
}
```

This example creates a task identified by function `void myTask()` with task-name
`taskname` that is executed every 50ms (50000us). On ESP8266 minimum schedule
time is around 50us.

The arduino main look simply needs to contain the line:
```c++
void loop() {
    sched.loop();
}
```
This calls the muwerk scheduler who dispatches the registered tasks.

Statistics
----------

If a message with topic `$SYS/stat/get` with string-encoded integer `N`
as message is received, the scheduler sends a statistics json object
to topic `$SYS/stat` every `N` milliseconds. If `N` is zero, no more
stat information is published.

Sample stat json (single output-line from `Examples/mac-linux`):

```json
{
    "dt" : 500001, "syt" : 57340, "apt" : 347452, "mat" : 10, "upt":2, "mem":2147483647, "tsks" : 2,
        "tdt" : [["task1", 1, 50000, 10, 99240, 7], ["task2", 2, 75000, 7, 34937, 0]]}
```

This example shows a `dt=500ms` sample, it has two tasks, `task1`, `id=1` was called
10 times, every 50ms, and used average 9.9240ms per call (task-code has approx. 10ms sleep),
and `task2`, `id=2` was called 7 times, every 75ms, and used average 4.991ms (5ms sleep in code).
Both tasks were always executed as schedules (negligable late-times `cn`).

See `Examples\mac-linux`. (Not available on ATTINY platforms, only ATMEGA
and better).

For systems that are connected to an MQTT-server (via [`munet`](https://github.com/muwerk/munet/blob/master/README.md)),
a python example script [mutop](https://github.com/muwerk/muwerk/tree/master/Examples/mutop) shows
how to parse the statistical information.

MQTT-like Communications and Architecture Overview
--------------------------------------------------

A more complete example is available at [blink](https://github.com/muwerk/muwerk/blob/master/Examples/minimal/src/mu_minimal.cpp)
that shows how tasks can communicate MQTT-style with each other and -- blink a led.

Tasks can communicate with each other using an MQTT-like pub/sub mechanism.
On ESP8266 or ESP32 platforms, the internal communication can be exported
transparently using [munet](https://github.com/muwerk/munet)'s interface to
the [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient) Arduino MQTT
library. The scheduler's task information is also exported via MQTT.

See the [documentation](https://muwerk.github.io/muwerk/docs/classustd_1_1Scheduler.html)
for more samples on muwerk's task scheduler and pub/sub intertask communication.

<img align="right" width="480" src="https://github.com/muwerk/muwerk/blob/master/Resources/console.jpg?raw=true">

The [`Console`](https://muwerk.github.io/muwerk/docs/classustd_1_1Console.html) class allows
to bind a serial console to muwerk that allows to inspect message passing, file system (if
available) and statistical information. See the
[`mu_console`](https://github.com/muwerk/muwerk/blob/master/Examples/console/mu_console.cpp)
example for more information.

RISC-V SDK, hence new names `ustd_queue.h` and `ustd_platform.h` etc.]

  * `ustd::Console` and `ustd::SerialConsole` do now honour the USTD_FEATURE_xxx defines.
  * Safe struct inits (no memset())

* 0.5.3 (2021-01-22) `UST_FEATURE_MEM` defines used (requires `ustd` version 0.4.1 or higher), ATtiny T_TASK limited to static functions.
* 0.5.2 (2021-01-20) `library.properties` project name repaired, to allow Arduino automatic update.
* 0.5.1 (2021-01-19)
  * Added `readString` with length validation to `ustd::jsonfile`
  * New task `ustd::doctor` implements a remote diagnostics interface via pub/sub messages.
  * `ustd::Console` has now a better interface for using other Printer-derived stream objects, `ustd::SerialConsole` can now be used with alternative serial interfaces
  * Improvements to stability and memory handling on `ustd::Scheduler`
  * Additional commandline options for `mutop`
* 0.5.0 (2021-01-15) Major update including:
  * New Serial Console class that provides a minimal interactive shell that can be extended with custom commands.
  * New portable filesystem functions that provide abstraction between LittleFS and SPIFFS (and in future others).
  * New class for managing JSON files with possibility to access members with an MQTT-topic-like path syntax.
  * New utility classes `heartbeat` and `timeout`.
  * New utility functions `shift` and `split` for string argument handling.
  * Analysis tool `mutop` that allows to monitor tasks and resource consumption for mqtt connected systems.
  * `$SYS/STAT` format expanded to contain uptime, free memory, and per-task infos task-id and schedule-time.
* 0.4.0 (2021-01-11) Optional serial console for muwerk, file system support for ESP8266 and ESP32.
* 0.3.2 (2020-12-25) Small platform updates, no functional change.

* 0.2.1 (2019-09-19) Functional support for AVRs via [`ustd::function<>`](https://muwerk.github.io/ustd/docs/index.html).
